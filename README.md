# ML-Project-with-synthea
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting diseases in patients based on their clinical and non-clinical observations. The dataset used in this project contains a wide range of patient observations, including laboratory results, vital signs, and social history data generated by Synthea

#### Step 1 - Generate data and cleaning
I use synthea toolkit with docker to generate my data: https://synthetichealth.github.io/spt/#/customizer
